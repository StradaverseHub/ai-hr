# Separate native integrity primitives from verified attendance

This refines ADR-0088's platform assumptions using the [platform evidence](../research/mobile-review-2026-10-27/platform-evidence.md).
It does not activate a trust tier, change attendance policy or enable offline acceptance.

The local Expo module owns platform key operations and platform artifacts. A bounded JavaScript
boundary validates their representation and reports `not_verified`. The future server verifier owns
certificate and token validation, app/environment identity, actor/employment/installation binding,
fresh challenges or permits, assertion counters and revocation. The attendance kernel continues to
own punch acceptance. Neither a reported hardware level nor a false mock-location flag proves presence.

There is no extractable JavaScript signing fallback. Missing capability, provider outage, malformed
evidence and obsolete operation ownership remain different outcomes. Account changes invalidate an
operation even if a native callback succeeds later. A deadline does not cancel platform key creation
and must not trigger automatic replacement. Apple identifiers are committed to device-only Keychain
storage before delivery to JavaScript; Android refuses an existing alias. Enrollment must persist its
scope and challenge before key creation. Apple's server-unavailable retry retains the same key and
the same client data hash. Persistence, reinstall and process-kill boundaries still require devices.

Raw clock snapshots stay app-local. Apple's required-reason rules permit elapsed app-event durations,
not exporting raw uptime or boot information. Keep exact nanoseconds as decimal strings and derive an
interval using bracketed readings; do not lose precision through JavaScript numbers. The interval is
unverified evidence, not an accepted timestamp. Wall-clock changes do not establish continuity.
iOS has no boot UUID in this implementation: compare events within one process, and return unknown
after restart. Android may compare a locally available boot counter. Reboot, conflicting markers,
counter discontinuity or missing continuity requires an explicit unknown result.

M04 server verification, native location-source metadata, signed-device acceptance and M05 permit and
adjudication protocols remain required. App Attest assertions can be generated locally, but this does
not make initial attestation or Google verification offline, nor prove the actual device acceptance
matrix. Compilation, syntax checks and port tests establish narrower facts than hardware verification.
