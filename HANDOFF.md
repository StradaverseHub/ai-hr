# Handoff — ai-hr

Updated after **every release/deploy**. This file holds ONLY the standing contract, the live state,
and the entry for any round still in flight. Shipped round entries live in
**`docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`** (newest first).

**Rules for updating this file — the old version grew to 5,900 lines of layered contradictions and
sessions drowned in it (three different "deployed head" claims coexisted; a fresh session could act on
any of them):**

- **CURRENT STATE is a snapshot, not a log.** When a fact changes, REPLACE the line — never prepend a
  new block above a stale one. If a number changes (deployed head, next migration, board counts), the
  old number leaves the file.
- **When a round ships:** update CURRENT STATE in place, move the round's entry to the TOP of
  `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`, delete the in-flight entry here, and **refresh the code graph**
  (`graphify update .` in this worktree — incremental, seconds, no LLM). The high-value part of each
  entry is **Decisions** — calls the tickets did not settle; those cannot be reconstructed from the
  diff.
- **Keep this file under ~700 lines.** If it is longer, something here belongs in history.

## CURRENT STATE — snapshot 2026-08-10 (r177 + r179 + r180 ALL SHIPPED · r178 was plans-only)

**`main@1d5ceab0` IS WHAT RUNS ON PRODUCTION, and there is NO pending deploy** — verified by a
zero-change `rsync -azi --delete --dry-run` after the last deploy (not by `deploy.sh` succeeding, which is
not proof). **Production is on 345 migrations. Next free migration is `0426`** (`0423` was allocated and
deliberately unused; gaps are fine).

**r177 IS NO LONGER HELD — it shipped 2026-08-10 with r179, on the owner's command.** `0425` applied
(344 -> 345) after a shadow rehearsal PASS against a live-shaped schema; the three `payroll_anomaly*` tables
exist on production. Everything this file used to say about r177 being held is history.

**⚠️ THE GATE NOW NEEDS `CHUNKS=6`.** The default 3 no longer fits the local volume — see
"Local Postgres" below. Four gates died on 2026-08-10 before this was understood.

**r176 (2026-08-10) SHIPPED ADR-0077 SLICES 6 AND 9** — full entry in `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`.
Slice 6's remaining piece (the deploy-failing flip) still needs the owner; slice 9 is complete.

### r177 · r179 · r180 — ALL SHIPPED 2026-08-10. Full entries in `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`.

**What is now live that was not this morning:** the ADR-0076 payroll anomaly layer (r177, migration `0425`,
three tables); `b00f9e6e` the overtime seeder guard; `388e53c2` Team Leave Tracker as the way in to the
three HR leave sections, including the sidebar-highlight fix that was the reporter's original complaint;
`98e69987` Transaction Detail; `f35f758a` the Individual Payslip screen and document. Gate on `main`:
**634 files across 6 chunks, every chunk exit=0, 8,050 tests**; tsc 0; `next build` clean; four-identity
render check with zero MISSING_MESSAGE.

⚠️ **TWO OF THOSE ITEMS CAME STRAIGHT BACK AS `contested`, AND THE REASON IS WORTH KEEPING.** `98e69987`
and `f35f758a` both removed the left-hand employee panel in favour of a top search field. The approved plan
EXPLICITLY warned that the reporter had previously asked for that panel to EXIST on the neighbouring payroll
screens (`f3ae3245`, `ec845c7d`, both deployed), said both could not be true, and offered "if you would
rather every payroll screen moved to a top row, reject this and say so". They approved it, saw it live, and
changed their mind. **The lesson is not that the warning failed — it is that a warning in prose does not
substitute for seeing it.** A mockup showed the new layout; nothing showed them what they were LOSING.
`f35f758a` additionally now wants preview in a NEW TAB, Earnings beside Deductions, a new Non-Payable
Amount section, and the bank account UNMASKED.

### ⚠️ THE ROSTER WRITE PERMISSION IS NOT SYMMETRIC — DELETE IS NOT GUARDED BY THE DATABASE

`roster_assignment_rls` is a `FOR ALL` policy, so `WITH CHECK` (`can_admin_employment`) governs INSERT and
the new row of UPDATE, while **DELETE is governed by `USING` alone (`can_see_employment`)** — which a
supervisor, and the employee themselves, both pass. Only the application guard `assertRosterAdmin` stops
`clearRoster`. The INSERT/UPDATE half WAS measured on production (a rolled-back transaction raised `42501`
on a tomorrow-dated row for a real direct report); the DELETE half rests on the policy text plus documented
PostgreSQL semantics, because the classifier blocked firing even a rolled-back DELETE.
**No live exposure — the app guard covers it — but "the database decides who may change the roster" is only
true for two of the three verbs, and any widening must split the policy or the two answers stay different.**
Full narrative: `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`.
### r184 (2026-08-11) — THE PAYROLL REPROCESS PAIR, BUILT AND DEPLOYED

`fbcf706d` (add a period-eligible employee to a processed run without resetting it) and `7076f8af` (Reset
lands back in the run flow; the adjustments panel and CSV import move off the run screen). Built in ONE
worktree, sequentially, because they overlap `app/payroll/[batchId]/page.tsx`, `app/payroll/actions.ts`,
`core/payroll.ts` and all six catalogues — the file-overlap rule, not the theme rule.
Gate **637 files / 6 chunks / every chunk exit=0 / 8,121 tests**; tsc 0; `next build` clean; render-checked
on a seeded dev server with zero MISSING_MESSAGE; deployed and proved by a zero-change dry-run.
**NO MIGRATION — `0426` is still free.**

**THE VERIFY-BEFORE-BUILDING GATE IS WHY THIS WORKED, AND IT SHOULD BE COPIED.** The plan's load-bearing
claim — that the subset path inserts a correct payslip for an employment with no payslip — was derived by
READING the engine and had never been executed: **0 of 123 production result-history rows had a null
`version_before`.** The build was gated on proving it first, with an explicit instruction to STOP and
re-plan if it failed. It held (gross 4000.00 at version 1, batch totals moved by the addition alone, the
already-paid payslip byte-identical), and measuring it turned three PREDICTED gaps into MEASURED ones:
`employee_count` stayed 1, the audit row rendered a phantom 0.00→4000 rise, and the no-salary case failed
closed with a misleading message. A premise that has never executed in production is a hypothesis; test it
before you build a screen on it.

**TWO MONEY GUARDS WERE ADDED BEYOND THE PLAN, AND THAT WAS RIGHT.** Item 5's scope bypass makes two
previously UNREACHABLE double-payment paths reachable: a claim allowance already written into
`payroll_input` by the draft-only prefill would be paid from the added payslip AND left payable on the next
run. Both now fail closed with a truthful message. **The claim mark-paid on a subset is deliberately
STRICTER than the full path** — the full generation infers "got a payslip therefore was disbursed" because
prefill and generation are one workflow; an add is not that workflow, so the requeue arm is not present on
a subset at all. A reviewer will notice the asymmetry; it is deliberate.

**`applyLoansForBatch` gained an OPTIONAL 5th parameter.** Omitted ⇒ byte-identical for the sole existing
caller. An empty array means "nobody" and returns early rather than widening to "all" — the difference
between those two readings is a double loan advance.

**THE PANEL WAS MOVED, NOT DELETED, and the board point was honoured BY PATH.** It is the only route by
which approved overtime, claims, loan instalments, shift differential, zakat, TP1 relief and attendance
allowances reach a payslip. Deleting it would leave approved amounts with no path to anyone's pay, silently.
`test/tp1-relief-reaches-payroll.test.ts` went red on all six bridges the moment the panel left the run
screen — it exists because `prefillTp1Action` once shipped bound to no form — and it was MOVED AND
STRENGTHENED, not relaxed. Seven prefill actions gained a `returnTo` because they hard-redirected to the
very screen this item removes from the path.

### ⚠️ THE FIXTURE TIME BOMB HAS NOW FIRED TWO NIGHTS RUNNING — READ THIS BEFORE "FIXING" IT AGAIN

On 2026-08-10 three leave-cancellation cases went red; on 2026-08-11 it was **11 cases across 3 files**,
mid-gate, at 00:24 MYT: `LeaveCancellationTooLateError: Leave for 2026-08-11 can no longer be cancelled`.
The fixtures hardcode a 10–12 Aug 2026 window chosen when that was "well in the future". **Each day more of
it rots into the past and the product correctly refuses.** The product is right; the tests are wrong.

**THE FIX IS TO PIN THE CLOCK, NOT TO MOVE THE WINDOW.** `edd9707d` tried deriving the window from
`todayInKualaLumpur()` and went from 3 failures to 16 — roughly 100 assertions are pinned to the literal
dates. Pinning the clock moves one variable; moving the window moves a hundred. `requestLeaveCancellation`
takes an injectable `today` for exactly this.

**TWO TRAPS INSIDE THE FIX, both of which bit on 08-11:**
1. **Some calls pass `today` as a SHORTHAND property**, not `today:`. A substring check for `today:` misses
   them and writes a DUPLICATE key. tsc catches it — match the property name with a regex.
2. **DO NOT PIN THE CLOCK-RELATIVE TESTS.** The past/future gate test derives its dates from
   `todayInKualaLumpur()` precisely so it holds whenever the suite runs. Pinning it made it PASS FOR THE
   WRONG REASON — it stopped rejecting, and the failure read `AssertionError: promise resolved`. A test
   that starts passing when you pin its clock is a test you have just broken.
State after 08-11: **24 pinned, 13 already pinned, 2 deliberately left on the real clock.**

⚠️ **`scripts/gate-chunked.sh` WIPES `ai_hr_dev`.** It rebuilds the cluster between chunks, which drops the
dev database with it. Both r184 build agents found 0 tenants and 0 payroll batches and could not render-check
because of it. **Seed AFTER the gate, never before** — and a render check run before a gate proves nothing
about the tree you are about to ship.

### ⚠️ r180 (2026-08-10) — TWO DEFECT FIXES, BOTH DEPLOYED. One of them was paying people twice.

**1. RECURRING PAY ITEMS HAVE BEEN PAYING TWICE, AND IT REACHED ISSUED PAYSLIPS.** Found while planning
board item `2f889bae`, then verified independently on production.

`setEmploymentPayComponent` closed the prior row ON the new start date, and its comment claimed "so there
is no double-count". **`validTo` is INCLUSIVE for pay components** — the kernel selects
`validFrom <= periodEnd AND (validTo IS NULL OR validTo >= periodStart)` and pays each returned row its
FULL amount — so both rows sat in the month containing the change.

MEASURED ON PRODUCTION, not inferred: **four employments carry overlapping live rows**, two of them real
customer records (Eee Lee Yong / Fiamma, TEST0002 / ISEDECOR). **Aisyah Rahman's 2026-04, 2026-05 and
2026-07 payslips each read allowance 140.00 where a single row gives 120.00** — RM20 per month on three
issued slips. One row is structurally impossible (`valid_from 2026-01-31`, `valid_to 2026-01-06`); Postgres'
own `daterange` refuses to construct it, which is how it surfaced.

**THE ROOT CAUSE IS A SEMANTIC MISMATCH BETWEEN TWO TABLES THAT SHARE A WRITER SHAPE.** `core/comp.ts` does
the IDENTICAL close-at-`effectiveFrom`, and compensation is safe — because its kernel reads a single open
row and its `compensation_no_overlap` EXCLUDE constraint uses a HALF-OPEN daterange, i.e. `valid_to` is
EXCLUSIVE there. Same writer, opposite boundary semantics, opposite safety. **Do not "align" one to the
other without moving the reader that goes with it** — this is recorded at the call site.

**WHAT SHIPPED:** the prior row is closed the DAY BEFORE the new start; a restatement from the row's own
start date SUPERSEDES it rather than inverting the window; a backwards restatement is refused. Chosen over
flipping the kernel's `gte` to `gt`, which would silently change what every EXISTING end-dated row pays in
its final month.

⚠️ **THE FIX IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT, AND THE SUITE SAYS SO.** A MID-MONTH restatement STILL pays
twice: the two windows are adjacent (`…-05-09` and `05-10-…`) but both overlap the month, and the kernel
pays full amount for any overlap. The first regression test written returned **1554 = 777 + 777**. It is
recorded as `it.fails` in `test/fixed-transaction.test.ts` — the same idiom this repo uses for the known
width no-op — so the gate goes RED when someone fixes it. **Fixing it is a DESIGN DECISION**: prorate a
partial window, take latest-row-wins per period, or refuse a mid-period restatement. Each changes what
correctly-dated rows pay today, so it belongs to the reporter, not to a patch.

**THREE EXISTING ASSERTIONS PINNED THE BUG** while calling it "no double-count"; they are corrected. The new
boundary test asserts the MONEY through a real payslip — the pre-existing "no double-count" test only ever
checked row shape and never generated a payslip, which is exactly how this shipped.

**NOT DONE, DELIBERATELY:** the data repair of the four employments and the overlap EXCLUDE constraint. Both
change customer records and sit in `2f889bae`'s pushed plan awaiting approval. The constraint CANNOT be
applied before the repair. **The uniqueness key is an open question** — the pending constraint is keyed on
employment + component, while board item `2aed39d4` asks for employee + pay item + PAYROLL CYCLE.

**THE REPORTER HAS INDEPENDENTLY REPORTED THE SAME DEFECT as `2aed39d4`** ("the system can create duplicated
Start Date / End Date / Payroll Cycle records ... incorrect payroll calculations"). They arrived from the UI,
we arrived from the data. Do not plan the work twice.

**CORRECTED MEASUREMENT:** the paid-item removal guard depends on payslips storing WHICH component produced
a line. This file used to cite 7 of 50 payslips (~14%). Re-measured 2026-08-10: **19 of 83 carry
`componentLines`**, and of the 24 live non-BASIC items a processed payslip covers, only 12 carry line
evidence — so the guard still refuses about half of what it should.

**2. THE PERSONNEL RECALC-REASON LABELS.** `people.detail.recalcReason.*` is a COMPUTED key, invisible to
i18n coverage check C. The page had a fallback that COULD NEVER FIRE: it compared the translated value
against the RELATIVE key while next-intl returns the FULLY-QUALIFIED path on a miss. Measured live:
**50 of 72 audit rows rendered a raw key path at the user**. Fixed with `t.has` (the house idiom —
`app/admin/scheduled-actions/page.tsx` does the same), so an unlabelled reason degrades to the raw word;
five missing labels added in all six catalogues. **It PREDATED r179** — the block is byte-identical at
`d51c8f4d`. `test/recalc-reason-labels.test.ts` pins both halves, strips comments before source assertions
(its own explanation quotes the broken expression), and deliberately does NOT claim to enumerate every
emitted reason: six catalogued reasons appear nowhere in source, so any static list is provably incomplete.

### r176, r175, r174, r173 and r172 are SHIPPED — full entries in `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`

One thing outlives those rounds and is deliberately NOT archived with them:

**NOT BUILT ON PURPOSE — Pay Items has no per-row Edit, and adding one naively DOUBLES PAY.**
`setEmploymentPayComponent` closes the open row at the new `effectiveFrom` and inserts a fresh one, while
the kernel selects every row overlapping the period — so re-stating an item inside its own running month
leaves BOTH rows in the window. The table already renders every column, so a View would be furniture.
**Safe editing needs a dating change, not a presentation change.**

### ⚠️ A SCRIPT THAT IS CORRECT AND MUST NOT BE RUN

- **`scripts/seed-overtime-multipliers.ts` IS DEPLOYED, CORRECT, AND MUST NOT BE RUN** (`2da9937a`, seed
  step withdrawn). A pay component was always the wrong mechanism: overtime is ALREADY wage-derived per
  employee (`localization/my/payroll.ts overtimePay`, multipliers and ceiling configurable per ADR-0019),
  and one flat rate for everyone cannot express that.

- ⚠️ **THE `OT1_5` DIAGNOSIS THAT USED TO SIT HERE IS NOW WRONG — THE REPORTER FIXED IT THEMSELVES
  (measured twice on production, r178).** This file used to state that `OT1_5` holds
  `{"kind":"per_hour","rate":1.5}` and is "the tenant's only `per_hour` item". **Production now has ZERO
  `per_hour` components.** On 2026-08-10 09:58:36 the reporter changed `OT1_5` to a **`formula`** rule —
  `(basic + fixed_allowances) / 26 / 8 * 1.5 * hours` — i.e. they took `b00f9e6e`'s "reject and we build
  it" option by building it. At 10:01:53 they keyed 10 hours, deriving **RM 396.63**, on processed payslip
  `ced390ae`. **DO NOT ARCHIVE `OT1_5`** — the approved revision-1 plan said to, and doing so now removes a
  working item and makes its three `payroll_individual_txn` rows uneditable
  (`core/payroll-individual-txn.ts:239` throws unconditionally).
  **`employment_pay_component` WAS THE WRONG TABLE TO CHECK**: revision 1's load-bearing sentence "nobody
  has ever been paid a cent from it" was already false when written — RM 2.00 was keyed 2026-08-04 and paid
  on processed payslip `c32b0088` on 08-07. **Verification trap:** both amounts are stored in the `bonus`
  column with `overtime_pay` 0.00, and read as overtime only through `statutory->'displayEarnings'`
  (`core/pay-display-category.ts:73-84`). Anyone checking `payslip.overtime_pay` will wrongly conclude the
  reporter's overtime never landed. Revision 2 is pushed and awaiting them.

### 6e9a126e RELEASE THREE — the one fact still live (full entry: history → r167)

**THE CUSTOMER STILL HAS ZERO ENTITLEMENT CONFIGURED.** Every figure reads blank until ~400 items are
retyped from the archive into Entitlement Templates + Employee Eligibility. The no-opinion guard is what
keeps balances still while that is true — if a recalc ever starts posting non-zero deltas against an
unconfigured type, that guard has broken and it is the first thing to check.

### The board

**Counts live in CURRENT STATE and are not repeated here. Always RE-COUNT** — the line said
`approved = 0` on 2026-08-08 and eight items were approved the next morning.

**AS OF 2026-08-11 THERE ARE ZERO OPEN AND ZERO CONTESTED ITEMS.** Counts on the box:
`deployed = 634` · `planned = 15` · `approved = 1` · `cancelled = 14`. The one approved item is
`c8052ae3`, which needs no build — only the operator run. **Every live item has a plan
awaiting the reporter**, including revisions for the two payroll screens they contested after r179 and an
answer to the attendance calculation question. **The constraint is no longer our planning throughput — it
is their approval throughput, fifteen deep. Look at that queue before planning anything new.**

**THE ONLY BUILDABLE WORK IS THE THREE APPROVED ITEMS**, and two of them are the same job:
`c8052ae3` needs no build at all (operator run; backup and rehearsal done, `--apply` outstanding), while
`fbcf706d` and `7076f8af` — joined by the now-planned `510f4bd1` — are ONE workflow, reprocessing an open
payroll period. Each of their plans says it must be decided once rather than three times. Build them
together or not at all.

⚠️ **A RAISED ITEM NEEDS A PLAN, NOT AN ANSWER — this file said the opposite and it cost a day.** An item
created by `improve:raise` lands `open` with `plan_revision = 0`, and **an item with no plan has no approve
or reject button**, so its recommendation sits in the description where the reporter can do nothing with it.
The old line here said `42afb2d2` "needs an ANSWER from the reporter, not a plan, and `improve:push-plan`
must never be pointed at it". That is backwards and is why it sat. Giving a raised question a PLAN is how
they answer it: approve means leave it, reject-with-reason means do the other thing.

**THE REPORTER COMMUNICATES IN PICTURES — 143 of 151 attachments are images.** Read an item's attachment
BEFORE forming any opinion; this session burned a plan revision writing from the prose alone and the
screenshot showed a different screen entirely.

### Plans must carry a MOCKUP — shipped r165

**The full procedure and its rules live in `scripts/mockup/README.md`** — read it before drawing one; it
is kept in step with `.claude/skills/feedback-plan`. The three that cost a round each, in brief: attach
AFTER pushing (`plan_revision` is stamped server-side, and `pushPlanWithMockups()` enforces the order);
a mockup is a PROMISE and a picture cannot hedge, so draw only what will be built and keep the uncertain
parts in words; and use the reporter's OWN measured data — r170 drew invented employees, and the
half-fix of real names with invented figures was worse, because it looks authoritative and is wrong.

**NOTHING IS `building` OR `approved`-and-unrecorded.** `improve:pull` hides `building`, so a partially
built item MUST be recorded here — nothing else surfaces it.

### THE DELETE GUARD (r160) — the count was the lesson (full entry: history → r160)

**A list of referrers maintained by hand is wrong the moment anyone adds a table.** `deleteLeaveType`
counted five, its `inUse` predicate counted three, and the database carried TWELVE foreign keys — both
the plans and this file said eleven. So there is no list: `core/leave-type-refs.ts` declares each
referrer with a disposition (`history` refuses, `config` cascades), both the button predicate and the
delete guard are GENERATED from it, and `test/leave-type-referrers.test.ts` fails if the declaration and
the live foreign keys disagree either way. Verified still in place 2026-08-09.

**`inUse` MEANS "this type has HISTORY"**, not "anything points at it" — a type carrying only policies
and approval rules is correctly deletable. `core/read.ts` documents the identical hazard for job grades.

### ⚠️ DECISIONS TAKEN THAT THE REPORTER SHOULD SEE

- **Notice Board ships MARKDOWN, not the requested WYSIWYG** — owner-approved 2026-08-05. Storing raw
  HTML would make every notice a stored-XSS vector aimed at every employee.
- **`3c473773` did NOT change the statutory calculation.** Its build note said `earningsOf` should
  switch on the new category — taken literally that moves EPF, SOCSO, EIS and PCB, contradicting the
  same plan's promise. Shipped as a decoupled DISPLAY overlay; stored payslip columns unchanged.
- **`18103ba4` refused Job Title / Employee Group / Employee Class** — no column, catalogue or import
  field exists. The screen NAMES them as unavailable rather than silently omitting them.
- **Claims stage 1 has no `reserved_amount` column**, deliberately: a stored counter is what gets
  decremented twice and silently frees limit that is still consumed.

### ⚠️ TWO OWNER DECISIONS OPEN ON ATTENDANCE — free to make NOW, expensive later

1. ⚠️ **THE OT ROUNDING RULE IS NOW COSTING REAL MONEY — THIS ENTRY USED TO SAY IT COST NOTHING.**
   The old text said "Production has exactly ONE rounding band — rule `A01` … it costs nobody anything
   yet: `A01` is not the tenant default and no shift selects it, so it decides ZERO days." **That was
   overtaken on 2026-08-05, when `A02` was created WITH a rounding band (60–119 minutes, round-to 60)
   and shifts began using it.** The hazard arrived by a different route than the one being watched.

   **MEASURED ON PRODUCTION 2026-08-10, and the arithmetic is visible in the data:** rounding to the
   NEAREST 60 sends anything from 90 minutes upward to 120 — **past the band's own 119-minute ceiling**
   — so a day inside the band is paid MORE than was worked. Two real days:

       Eee Lee Yong             2026-08-05  out 19:30   ot_minutes 120   worked  90
       NURUL ALIAH BINTI ACHIN  2026-08-05  out 19:40   ot_minutes 120   worked 100

   Every other overtime day on production matches its raw minutes exactly. So this is 30 + 20 minutes
   of overtime nobody worked, and it also creates a cliff: 1h29 pays one hour, 1h30 pays two, 2h00
   pays two — an extra half hour earns nothing.

   **NOT YET FIXED.** A plan is on the board under `7c834696` (which the reporter raised as a QUESTION —
   "why is the lateness and early out calculation wrong, show me A02" — and the answer is that lateness
   and early-out are RIGHT and overtime is not). The fix reduces two employees' recorded overtime, so it
   goes through approval rather than shipping as a bug fix.
   `test/attendance-stage1-calc.test.ts` pins today's behaviour against `A01`'s geometry; changing the
   rounding will fail a test that names the exact minutes that move — update it, do not loosen it.

   **A02's OTHER SETTINGS, verified, because they read as bugs and are not:** grace is 5 minutes on
   arrival and **0 on departure**, and `include_grace_in_lateness` is TRUE — so a 09:06 arrival counts
   6 minutes late, not 1, because once the grace is spent it stops counting in the employee's favour at
   all. `apply_deductions` is FALSE, so no lateness or early-out deduction has ever been taken from
   anyone's pay, on any day.
2. **"Overtime beyond the final band shall not be counted"** would cut `ot_minutes` DOWNWARD and
   retroactively. Not built — those minutes keep the final band's rate. Truncation needs its own opt-in.


### ⚠️ THE PAID-ITEM GUARD IS ONLY ~14% EFFECTIVE TODAY, AND THAT IS BY DESIGN

`f1123afd` refuses to remove a recurring pay item paid on a processed payslip, but it can only fire where
the payslip stored WHICH component produced a line — measured 2026-08-05, **7 of 50 payslips** carry
`statutory.componentLines`. Line stamping began 2026-08-01 (`862ed0ad`) and earlier runs cannot be
itemised retrospectively.

**There is no payslip line table.** Per-item detail lives in `payslip.statutory` jsonb keyed by catalog
CODE, not by `employment_pay_component.id`, so the guard also needs the batch's `pay_period` to fall
inside that row's own validity window to attribute a line to it rather than a sibling.

**With no stored evidence the removal is ALLOWED, deliberately** — refusing on absence of evidence would
block removing almost every pre-August recurring item with no way to prove otherwise. Pinned by a test, so
reversing it means changing a test and saying why. **It is protection going forward, not a repair of
history** — say that plainly rather than implying paid items are protected.

### Durable product facts and unbuilt follow-ups (measured 2026-08-04/05; the items themselves SHIPPED)

Per-item measurements are in `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md` under their rounds. What outlives them:

- **`employment_type` lives on `assignment`, NOT `employment`** — a query against
  `employment.employment_type` errors.
- **`EMERGENCY_LEAVE_CODE = 'EMERGENCY'` is still hardcoded** while production's type is `EL` — the
  constant is documented as "the code the PACK SEEDS" and the resolver has changed, so **re-verify
  against the tree before reusing the old diagnosis**; its old line numbers have moved.
- **"Processed By" on the payroll dashboard is viable** — 43 processed events, 43 with a resolvable
  actor name. A two-join + one-`<td>` change; shipped without it only because an agent could not
  verify from its sandbox.

### Waiting on the owner, not on code

1. **Slice 6's deploy-failing flip** (unclassifiable company: warning → failed deploy) needs explicit
   confirmation before shipping — right end state, deliberate foot-gun.

**FIVE cron jobs now, not four (2026-08-09).** `accrue-earned` (monthly, 1st 02:00), `review-sweep`
(daily 03:00), `expire-carry` (yearly, 1 Apr 03:00), `provision-runner` (every minute), and
**`capture-usage` (daily 01:00)** — ahead of the leave sweeps so it meters the day before they mutate
it. **`expire-aged-leave` is NOT among them** (an older note here claimed five including it; its line
is commented out on the box). **Verify with `crontab -l` as `ubuntu`, NOT `systemctl list-timers`** —
no timers exist.

### Known live defects, deliberately left standing

- **THERE ARE SIX INLINED COPIES OF THE SHIFT SPAN-MINUS-BREAK CALCULATION, and the sixth cannot be
  deduplicated (r174).** The canonical one is `netScheduledMinutes`; `rosterVariance` was the fifth and
  was fixed this round after it disagreed with the engine on a rounded shift. The sixth is
  `components/shift-time-fields.tsx:63-71`, which recomputes span, the unpaid-only break sum and the
  rounding floor by hand. **It is CORRECT today** — already rounding-aware and paid-aware — but nothing
  tests that it tracks the engine, and it is `'use client'` while `core/attendance.ts` imports
  `db/client` and drizzle, so it CANNOT import the shared helper. If the scheduling rule changes again,
  this is the copy that silently drifts. The real fix is extracting `netScheduledMinutes`/`shiftSpan`
  into a dependency-free module both sides can import. Two further copies exist at
  `core/attendance.ts:279` and `app/admin/attendance-policy/page.tsx:251` — those are the
  `attendance_policy` domain, which has no rounding column and no shift, and must NOT take the shift
  rounding parameter.

- **`${inputCls} w-<n>` is a width NO-OP in ~133 files** — `inputCls` contains `w-full`, and the
  stylesheet's emission order wins, not the class attribute. Recorded as `it.fails` in
  `test/tailwind-width-order.browser.test.tsx`, so the gate turns RED when someone fixes it. Not on
  the board yet (awaiting the owner). Fix is `tailwind-merge` (already a dependency) or dropping
  `w-full` from `inputCls`; **both change rendered widths across 133 files — measure before
  planning.**
- **Sepang location carries `country = 'SG'`** on a Malaysian company — a data-entry slip, harmless
  since r110 (state validation narrows by the COMPANY's country). A human should fix the row; **a
  validator silently rewriting customer data would be worse than the error.**

### What I would pick up next (platform work from ADR-0077 — NOT on the board; nothing will surface it except this entry)

- **Finish slice 6**: sweep remaining reports for one-jurisdiction assumptions — grep `packFor(` in
  `core/` and check each against "whose jurisdiction is this row?". r115 fixed the overtime report.
- **Provision slice 7** — create `ai_hr_platform` from `deploy/bootstrap-db.sql`, set
  `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL`. No code; turns `pnpm platform:usage` from exit-2 into a working report.
- **Slice 9's ONE gap: give `closureDecision` a caller.** Decision function, retention check and schema
  are built and tested; nothing invokes them. Reactivation already has its runner.
- **Slice 10's dashboard**, now that the meter records daily. Wants slice 7 provisioned first.
- **The old line here called 7 and 8 "the big untouched ones" — wrong for both.** This table has now
  gone stale on 7, 8, 9 and 10 in turn: **check the tree before believing any row of it.**

## Settled decisions — do not reopen

- **`fa3f4ccb` statutory minimum removal is SETTLED — do not re-refuse.** The reporter asked twice
  with reasoning; a reaffirmed instruction is the owner's decision. The configured figure wins and the
  EA 1955 floor renders as a non-blocking warning. **Scope: entitlement DAYS only** —
  `core/leave.ts:553`/`:557` (the right to APPLY) and the `updateLeaveType` statutory guard are NOT in
  scope. Keep `floorDays` in the return shape; recomputing the floor in the UI is how figures drift.
- **ANNUAL carry-forward expiry is 6 months** (`0333`, r85) — the reporter's policy change. "My
  carried leave disappeared early" is intended behaviour, not a bug.
- **`c33d9bbb` is PARKED BY THE OWNER** (2026-07-31) and is now `cancelled` on the board — re-counted
  2026-08-05, correcting an older line here that said it "stays `contested`". Either way, writing a
  rev 2 would re-open a settled decision.
- **`reporter_label` is DISPLAY ONLY** — `raiseFeedback` stamps `'CLAUDE AI'`. **Never "simplify" this
  into a synthetic person + employment**: `reporter_employment_id` drives RLS `can_see_employment()`
  and a fake employment row would join `openLeaveYear`, payroll and every employee list.
- **The entitlement page header stays empty** (`962077a8`, guarded by
  `test/entitlement-header-actions-removal.test.ts`).
- **Never edit an applied migration file** — drizzle records a content hash. (`0333`'s header
  mislabels itself as the guard; the guard is `0334`. Left uncorrected on purpose.)
- **Per-band carry-forward columns/JSONB/readers are retained, not dropped** (r85) — do not "tidy"
  them away.
- **`transferEmployee` has zero production callers and is kept deliberately** — it is the only writer
  of `assignment.transferred`, which `reverseLegTx` still replays. Not dead code.

## How this project is actually run

**Deploy is automatic after a green gate** (owner's override of ADR-0045; AGENTS.md carries the rule).

**THE GATE, IN FULL — and the middle line is the one that keeps being got wrong:**
`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` · **`bash scripts/gate-chunked.sh`** · `pnpm exec next build` ·
`pnpm gate:shadow` whenever a migration is involved.
**NOT `pnpm vitest run`.** A bare full run exhausts the RAM disk and kills the cluster mid-suite — it
produced two false red gates on 2026-08-06 alone (293 and 9 failed files, zero assertion failures both
times). The shadow rehearsal is the one that catches a journal `when` collision, which is a SILENT SKIP.

**Deploy mechanics.** SSH port **8288**, `ubuntu@203.142.6.241`, app at `/opt/ai-hr`. rsync (excluding
node_modules/.next/.git/.env*/.turbo/coverage/.claude/graphify-out) then `./deploy/deploy.sh` on the box,
which migrates, seeds catalogs, runs backfills and restarts. **The server has NO git checkout** —
`git log` there tells you nothing. **Run deploy.sh under `nohup … &` and poll its LOG**: it outlives a
10-minute ssh, and `pgrep -f deploy/deploy.sh` matches the waiter's own command string (cost 10 minutes
on 2026-08-06). `GET /` returning **401** is CORRECT — the password gate, not a failure.

**Before planning ANYTHING, run BOTH of these checks. Neither one finds what the other does.**

**1. Is `main` itself ahead of production?** (r159: it was, by a whole release.) This is the check
that did not exist before r159 and the only one that would have caught r158 sitting merged and
undeployed. It costs seconds and needs no branch archaeology:

    cd .claude/worktrees/mainwt && rsync -azi --delete --dry-run \
      -e "ssh -p 8288 -o BatchMode=yes" \
      --exclude node_modules --exclude .next --exclude .git --exclude '.env*' \
      --exclude .turbo --exclude coverage --exclude .claude --exclude graphify-out \
      ./ ubuntu@203.142.6.241:/opt/ai-hr/

Zero lines = production matches `main`. Anything else is an undeployed release, no matter what
CURRENT STATE claims. **Do this before trusting any "what runs" line in this file, including the one
above** — that line has been wrong.

**2. Is there an unshipped BRANCH?** — r86 was 13 finished items sitting unmerged while `main` stood
at r85, and a finished round nobody shipped looks exactly like no round:

    for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/heads/build); do \
      n=$(git rev-list --count main..$b); \
      [ "$n" != 0 ] && echo "$b: $n unmerged"; done

(Use `for-each-ref`, not `git branch --list | tr -d ' *'` — the old form here mangled the `+` marker
git prints for branches checked out in another worktree and produced a screenful of
`unknown revision +build/rNNN`.)

Then LOOK at what it prints — the count alone lies (`build/r71` reports 4 unmerged commits whose
content reached main by another route). Confirm with `git diff --stat main <branch>`: main deleting
thousands of lines means the branch is old, not pending. A real pending round has recent commits, an
integration commit, and a small diff of genuinely new files.

**Reply on Telegram when the owner writes from Telegram.** Terminal output never reaches their chat.

## The feedback board — how the loop works

**Commands** (all from a checkout, `IMPROVE_SSH_HOST=203.142.6.241 pnpm improve:<cmd>`):
`pull` (open + contested ONLY — it hides `building`) · `pull-approved` · `pull-blocked` · `push-plan` ·
`block` / `unblock` · `build-start` / `build-complete` · `release` · `mark-deployed` · `raise`.
The CLI default host `10.20.30.20` is LAN-only — always set `IMPROVE_SSH_HOST`.

Parsing tip: `pnpm` prints a banner before the JSON. Split on the first `\n[\n`, not the first `[`.

**Plans are PLAIN TEXT.** The board renders them RAW — no Markdown. There is a skill for this:
`.claude/skills/feedback-plan`. Read it before writing any plan. Business language above the dashed
line, all technical detail in the BUILD NOTES trailer below it.

**Approve carries NO payload.** A plan that asks the reporter to choose between options can never be
answered — one item sat unbuilt three rounds that way. State ONE course of action, recommend it, and
tell them to reject with a reason if they want otherwise.

**Statuses:** open → planned → approved → building → done → deployed, plus `contested` (pushed back,
re-plan from the reporter's latest words) and `blocked` (approved but waiting on an answer).
`startFeedbackBuild` accepts ONLY `approved`, which is what makes `blocked` a real guard.

**Plan history is immutable** (`feedback_plan_revision`, append-and-close-once, by policy and by
trigger). Read a plan's `KNOWN OPEN POINTS FROM REVIEW` block before building it — that is where
unresolved objections are recorded, with citations.

**Adversarial plan-critique loops do not converge.** r123 spent 34 agents / ~3.2M tokens over two
rounds on 10 contested plans; verifiers confirmed round-1 fixes landed, then found deeper, different
defects each pass. 0 of 10 survived and there is no stopping rule. Do not simply run another round.

## Running builds with subagents

Established pattern (r73–r137). The rules, each learned the hard way:

- **Create each agent's worktree yourself FROM `main` and pass the path.** `isolation: 'worktree'`
  cuts from the repo root's HEAD, which is `local/root-scratch` — **114+ commits behind main**. Two of
  r126's three agents built against an r91-era tree this way.
- **Hand each agent an explicit migration number** — left alone they all pick the same next one.
- **Every agent needs its own `TEST_DB_NAMESPACE`** — without it they drop each other's template
  mid-run and both result sets become noise. A fresh worktree has no `node_modules`.
- **Group by FILE OVERLAP, never by theme.** If two items touch the same screen, one agent.
- **Ownership is assigned by FUNCTION, not by file** (r139, six workstreams / seven items, zero
  collisions). Three payroll items all needed `core/payroll-view.ts`; each was given named functions
  and told to STOP AND REPORT rather than edit outside its lane.
- **Only ONE agent per round may own each exact-set registry** — `packs/payroll` nav + `EXPECTED_SET`,
  `ADMIN_GROUP_FLAT_HREFS`, the dashboard card catalogue. Two branches editing the same literal is a
  guaranteed conflict, and r159 hit the same class from the other side: two workstreams independently
  tripping one drift guard.
- **THAT RULE HAS A HOLE, AND r174 FELL IN IT: OWNERSHIP COVERS EDITS, NOT SIDE EFFECTS.**
  `lib/permissions.ts` was assigned to the audit workstream for a route REMOVAL. A different
  workstream ADDED a guarded `page.tsx` (`/admin/leave/entitlements/ledger-archive`) and never touched
  the registry, so `test/function-access.test.ts` reverse-completeness failed at the integration gate —
  the one place it could be caught, since no single agent could see it. **Either the integrator owns
  every registry edit, or every agent that adds a guarded page must declare it in its report.** Ask
  each agent for the list; do not infer it from the diff at merge time.
- **Anything cross-cutting runs SOLO and LAST**, against the settled tree.
- **Tell each agent the traps its items will hit** — the guards it must not weaken, the writers that
  recently broke. The best results come from briefs that name the specific hazard.
- **Agents must REPRODUCE before fixing — the single highest-yield rule in this file.** Repeatedly,
  reported faults were not the described bug. Check in this order: **already built → mislabelled →
  on the adjacent screen → the reporter's diagnosis inverted → wider than reported** — BEFORE
  checking *absent*. A held-back item with findings is a good result.
- **Enumerate every caller before changing any of them.** The enumeration is often worth more than
  the fix.
- **The integration gate catches what no agent can see.** Per-agent runs are necessary and never
  sufficient.
- **Before running a Workflow here:** async agents are killed after 3 minutes of silence and this
  repo's test startup exceeds that — `.claude/settings.local.json` sets
  `CLAUDE_ASYNC_AGENT_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS=600000`.

## The code graph — query it before spelunking

**`graphify-out/` in THIS worktree holds a knowledge graph of the whole codebase**, built from local
tree-sitter AST (no API key, no LLM). Untracked and rsync-excluded; regenerable in ~a minute.

**Use it FIRST when you need to understand code** — who calls what, with file:line, read from the tree
rather than from this file's prose (line numbers in prose go stale; the graph does not — it already
corrected one of this file's own citations). All commands run from this worktree:

    graphify explain "applyLeaveTypeRules"     # a node + every caller/import, with file:line
    graphify query "how does X reach Y?"       # BFS over the graph, --budget N tokens (default 2000)
    graphify path "requestLeave" "core/payroll.ts"   # shortest path between two nodes
    graphify affected "withTenant" --depth 2   # reverse traversal: what breaks if X changes
    graphify god-nodes --top 20                # the architectural hubs
    graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md               # community map of the codebase (labels = hub node names)

**Every build updates it:** `graphify update .` after any merge to main (seconds, no LLM); add
`--force` after a refactor that deletes a lot of code.

**Known limitations:** the 313 `.sql` migration files are not parsed (`tree_sitter_sql` not
installed — the live schema is the drizzle TS, which IS in the graph); community labels are
hub-node names, not LLM prose (semantic naming needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`); `graph.html` is not
generated (the 5,000-node viz limit) — the CLI queries are the interface. **Symbols exported
through destructuring under-report**: `explain "withTenant"` resolves to a `{ db, client,
withTenant }` node with no caller edges, while a plain exported function (`applyLeaveTypeRules`)
shows all 22. When `explain`/`affected` come back thin on a symbol you know is hot, fall back to
grep — an empty result is a parser gap, not proof of no callers.

## Environment — read before you lose an hour

### Worktrees and which tree you are on

- The repo ROOT (`~/Projects/ai-hr`) is a SCRATCH worktree on `local/root-scratch`, far behind main.
  **`main` lives at `.claude/worktrees/mainwt`.** The root's HANDOFF.md is a stub pointing here.
- **Check `pwd` and the branch in EVERY gate command, and read vitest's `RUN` line + file count.**
  A gate run in the wrong tree reports GREEN for the wrong code — this has bitten three times
  (r79, r83, r86), each via a single `cd` that left the shell at the root.
- ~30 stale `build/r*` worktrees sit under `.claude/worktrees/`, all merged, safe to prune.
  `git worktree remove` deletes the DIRECTORY, not the branch; the only thing removal can lose is
  uncommitted work — check `git -C <path> status --porcelain`, not `git log main..<branch>`.

### Local Postgres — the wedge is FIXED; do not re-diagnose it (full diagnosis: history → r160)

- Data dir **`/opt/homebrew/var/aihr-pg16`** (a SYMLINK to a RAM disk), binaries
  **`/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@16/bin`** (keg-only — PG14 shadows `psql` on PATH, use the explicit
  path or `pnpm db:start`). Port **5433**.
- **Misbehaving? Run `./scripts/dev-db-rebuild.sh`** (<1 min). It puts the data dir on an 8GB RAM disk
  (mounted at `<DATA>-ram` with `<DATA>` a symlink, because `initdb` refuses a mount point as PGDATA),
  sets the WAL sizes **conditionally on the volume type** (see the two bullets below), keeps `fsync=off`,
  and creates the `NOBYPASSRLS` role. Opt out with `AIHR_RAMDISK_GB=0`. **A RAM disk does not survive a
  reboot** — and if it dies mid-run it can leave a worker DB in `invalid` state, which reads as
  `cannot connect to invalid database`; drop those (`datconnlimit = -2`) or just rebuild.
- **NEVER blame the cluster first.** Every earlier version of this section did, and r160 lost hours to
  it. The real bug was `resetDb()`'s TRUNCATE having no `lock_timeout` while TWO pools sat on every
  worker DB; it is fixed in `test/harness.ts` (5s timeout + bounded retry inside ONE transaction).
- **THE DIAGNOSTIC RULE, which has now paid out four times: A RED GATE WITH NO ASSERTION FAILURES IS A
  HARNESS OR ENVIRONMENT PROBLEM.** `grep -c AssertionError` the log BEFORE reading a single failure.
  Three of the four were a background process — a live Workflow, a stale dev server — still holding the
  cluster while the gate ran. **Kill the dev server in the same command that finishes a render check.**
- **The suite generates ~10GB of WAL per full run, more than this machine retires in real time**, so
  **always use `CHUNKS=6 bash scripts/gate-chunked.sh`**, never a bare `pnpm vitest run`: it rebuilds
  the cluster between chunks, covers BOTH vitest projects, and asserts vitest COUNTED as many files as
  it was asked to run (a file whose worker fails to spawn is not counted and reads as green). The real
  cure is in the harness — `CREATE DATABASE … TEMPLATE` instead of a ~100-table TRUNCATE per file — and
  is worth doing deliberately, not at the end of a release.
- **`CHUNKS=6`, NOT the default 3 — measured 2026-08-10.** A 209-file chunk reached 5.1GB of WAL against
  the 8GB volume and was still climbing; at 105 files per chunk the volume sits near 12% and checkpoints
  retire cleanly. 627 files went green in 6 chunks.
- **NO WAL SETTING SUBSTITUTES FOR CHUNKING, so do not go tuning instead.** `pg_wal` settles at roughly
  *write rate x checkpoint duration*. `max_wal_size` decides when a checkpoint STARTS — it does NOT
  throttle writers — and `checkpoint_timeout` has a hard 30s floor (`15 s is outside the valid range …
  (30 .. 86400)`). At the ~130MB/s this suite generates, the arithmetic floor is ~4GB and it ran to 7GB.
  Three settings were tried on the RAM disk (min 3GB/max 1GB, min 1GB/max 2GB, min 192MB/max 512MB) and
  **all three filled it**. Bounding the RUN is the only lever.
- **`min_wal_size`/`max_wal_size` now differ BY VOLUME, and the reasons are opposite.** `dev-db-rebuild.sh`
  picks: ON DISK `min 3GB / max 4GB` (unlinks were the ~8s AV-scanned bottleneck, so a big pool makes
  Postgres RECYCLE by rename instead); IN RAM `min 192MB / max 512MB` (unlinks are free, so the pool buys
  nothing and every byte is charged against a volume that cannot grow). The old config had `min 3GB`
  under `max 1GB` — a floor above the ceiling, which Postgres accepts silently because pacing reads
  `max` and retention reads `min`.
- **THE FIRST COMMAND ON ANY RED GATE IS A CAUSE GREP, not reading test names.** On 2026-08-10 the
  failure list was read three times (2,766 failures / 344 files, zero assertion errors) before anyone
  grepped for the actual cause, which was `could not extend file … No space left on device` (SQLSTATE
  53100) — the volume had filled and killed the cluster mid-run. Run:
  `grep -oE "(PostgresError|AssertionError)[^\"]{0,80}" <log> | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head`
- **Apex One** real-time scanning of the data directory was excluded by the owner 2026-08-04; keep it.

### Running and reading test gates

- **One vitest at a time.** A second concurrent run wipes the first's worker databases. Parallel
  agents each get their own `TEST_DB_NAMESPACE`; otherwise do NOT invent one (leaked namespaces once
  reached 366 databases, which slows CRASH RECOVERY catastrophically, not checkpoints).
- **Redirect long commands to a FILE, never a pipe** (`> log 2>&1`). An undrained pipe hangs the
  command at 0% CPU forever, and an exit code read through a pipe is the LAST command's (`rsync … |
  tail -3; echo $?` reports tail's — this once turned a half-transferred deploy green).
- **"Is it stuck?" — read the LOG, never the process list.**
  `grep -E "Test Files|Tests |Duration" <log> | tail -4`. A `Duration` line means DONE regardless of
  the process table (vitest often does not exit after reporting; teardown takes minutes and emits
  nothing).
  **CORRECTED r137: "no Duration + GROWING log = still working" is wrong for a redirected run.**
  Vitest's reporter BUFFERS in non-TTY mode, so the log sits at its `[global-setup]` line and does
  not grow at all for the entire run — 15 minutes of silence is the NORMAL healthy state, not a
  symptom. **The liveness signal is the test-DB connection count**, which tracks real work:

      psql -p 5433 -U postgres -d postgres -At \
        -c "select count(*) from pg_stat_activity where datname like 'ai_hr_test%'"

  Healthy mid-run is ~16–22 with several `active`. Genuine hang = no `Duration` AND zero connections.
  A full suite now takes **~950 s** (558 files / 6612 tests), longer than the 761 s recorded earlier.
- **Never `pgrep -f` a string your own waiter contains** — `until [ "$(pgrep -f 'vitest.mjs run' …`
  matches itself and waits forever.
- **Read vitest's EXIT CODE and file count, never just the summary.** A file whose worker fails to
  spawn is not counted AT ALL — r91 printed `513 passed (513)` on a 514-file tree and exited 1. The
  `browser` project's `*.browser.test.tsx` file being outside `pnpm vitest run` is EXPECTED (one-file
  gap); anything else is not.
- **`TaskStop` does not stop server-side statements a test run started** — kill the client, then
  check `pg_stat_activity` and cancel what it left behind (one orphaned `CREATE DATABASE` once turned
  12 unrelated tests into 30 s timeouts).
- **Test layers:** `pnpm vitest run` = node + jsdom `dom` projects together (the gate).
  `pnpm test:browser` = real Chromium + real Tailwind (`getComputedStyle`), opt-in, deliberately
  OUTSIDE the gate until it has a track record. `globalSetup` is inherited by `extends: true`
  projects — declare it on the project that needs it, never at the root, and count the
  `[global-setup]` lines in the output.

### Migrations

- **The JOURNAL is the migration.** A `.sql` file without a `db/migrations/meta/_journal.json` entry
  silently never runs. `test/migration-journal-ordering.test.ts` catches it — but only if you run the
  suite, not just your new test file. The test-template fingerprint hashes the journal (r112), so
  adding the entry forces a real template rebuild.
- **Allocate numbers centrally — never let an agent pick one.** Parallel agents independently pick
  the same next number; hand them out up front (gaps are fine and deliberate).
- **A stale number is a SILENT SKIP.** drizzle reads the last applied `when` as a watermark and
  ignores journal entries below it. Before merging ANY held branch, compare its journal `when`
  against the deployed watermark and renumber above it (SQL file + journal `idx`/`when`/`tag` + any
  comment citing the number). Reused numbers merge as the same silent skip.
- **A migration that CREATEs a table must also GRANT on it.** Production's
  `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` masks the omission; a dev cluster restored from a dump has no such
  default and the first render through `ai_hr_app` throws `permission denied`. No test sees it — the
  suite connects as the owner. Copy `0345`/`0354`/`0357`.

### Rendering and verification

- **A 200 is NOT a render check.** `MISSING_MESSAGE` shows ONLY in the dev-server log on a real
  render — tsc, the suite, `next build` and the route's 200 all stay green. Three shipped this way in
  five rounds (r123 server/client boundary, r127 twelve labels, r134 the Cycle field on every payroll
  run page). The recipe costs five minutes:

      pnpm db:seed && PORT=3111 pnpm dev
      curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://localhost:3111/admin/leave/entitlements
      # …then READ the dev-server log for MISSING_MESSAGE

- **Server components passing closures to client components also pass every gate** (r123 broke
  production this way; the reporter found it). `test/server-client-boundary.test.ts` pins the class.
- **Browser verification runs against a LOCAL dev server with the `dev_user` identity switcher —
  never production** (WorkOS OAuth). `cloudflared` runs ON THE SERVER — a local `pgrep` means
  nothing; curl the tunnel URL WITHOUT `-f` (401 is the healthy password gate). The tunnel hostname
  changes if that process restarts.
- **Fetching page HTML to grep for a label is a false positive** — Next.js embeds the whole i18n
  catalog in the payload. Check the component source or a real render.

### The server

- ssh `-p 8288 ubuntu@203.142.6.241`; you may `sudo systemctl restart aihr` yourself.
- Default `node` is v18 and predates `--env-file` — prefix `PATH=/opt/node20/bin:$PATH` or chase a
  phantom "bad option" bug.
- **CORRECTED r137: the deploy rsync DOES carry `--delete`.** `scripts/improve/release.ts:71` has it,
  and r137's two deleted files were verified gone from the box afterwards. The older warning here
  ("no `--delete`", from r128) is **wrong for the release path** — but `--delete` only protects you if
  you actually pass it, so keep it in any hand-rolled rsync, and note excluded paths
  (`node_modules`, `.next`, `.env*`) are protected from deletion, which is why `.env.production`
  survives. Still worth listing what a release removes:
  `git diff --diff-filter=D --name-only <last-released-ref>..HEAD`.
- **Proof a deploy arrived** is `rsync -azi --delete --dry-run` reporting ZERO changes afterwards —
  `deploy.sh` succeeding is not it (a broken pipe once left 93 stale files behind a green deploy).
  Plain `--dry-run` prints nothing without `-i`. Use `--partial --timeout=120` and
  `ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=15`.
- **`next build` on the box runs BEFORE `db:migrate`** — an OOM aborts with production untouched and
  the old `.next` still serving; verify (`systemctl is-active aihr`, `GET /` 401, migration count)
  rather than assume. `NODE_OPTIONS` heap is 4096 MB against 3.9 GB RAM + 3.9 GB swap; past that it
  is a bigger-box problem. **Never `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors`** — the build's type pass catches
  RSC boundary errors `tsc` alone does not.

## Traps — the durable ones (each cost at least a round; several recurred AFTER being written down)

- **MERGED IS NOT DEPLOYED, AND THIS FILE HAS ASSERTED OTHERWISE (r159).** r158 was merged to `main`,
  including migration `0403`, and never shipped; CURRENT STATE said "no pending deploy, nothing in
  flight" and the board still showed all three items `approved`. Every signal agreed and every signal
  was wrong. The failure mode is structural, not careless: the unshipped-round check reads `build/*`
  branches, and merged work has none; the board reads status, and nobody had called `build-start`.
  **A dry-run rsync against the box is the only cheap ground truth for "what is actually running".**
  Corollary — after a merge, the deploy is not optional bookkeeping you can leave for the next round:
  the next agent will read `main` as shipped.

- **THE IMPORT RATCHET DOES NOT STRIP COMMENTS, so a comment that quotes an import is read as a real
  edge (r159).** `lib/completed-years.ts` imports NOTHING, and the leave pack-drift guard failed it
  anyway: its header explained which specifier `core/leave.ts` re-exports, spelled as a literal
  `from '…'`, and `test/helpers/import-ratchet.ts` matched it. **Before believing a drift violation,
  open the flagged file and look for a quoted specifier inside a comment.** The fix is to reword the
  comment — never to add an allowlist entry (that list is audited debt and only shrinks) and never to
  "fix" the scan: a regex comment-stripper mangles `//` inside string literals and would start MISSING
  imports. Comment blindness can only ADD edges, which fails loud; the alternative fails silent. That
  trade is now written into the helper's header.

- **A GUARD THAT READS ONE FILE'S SOURCE BREAKS WHEN A FIELD IS EXTRACTED INTO A COMPONENT — and the
  tempting fix deletes the protection (r159).** `35b7af0a` group 4 moved EPF Number/Citizenship into a
  shared component; three static-source guards stopped finding `name="epfNumber"` on the page. Two of
  them are wipe guards on a FULL-ROW overwrite form, where a field missing from the POST silently
  clears the column — exactly what must not be dropped. Following the string alone is also wrong: the
  component contains the name whether or not the page still renders it, and `mode="controlled"` emits
  `value`/`onChange` with **no `name` at all**. So a guard that follows an extraction needs three
  things, not one: the field exists in the component, the page renders that component, and it renders
  it in the mode that actually posts. Note also that a form-mode prop object (`name: 'epfNumber'`)
  mounts an input exactly as a JSX attribute (`name="epfNumber"`) does — accept both spellings or
  every future extraction fails for a cosmetic reason.

- **A NAIVE JSON DEEP-MERGE RESURRECTS DELETED KEYS — and the six message catalogs are where it bites.**
  When two parallel branches both edit `messages/*.json`, git conflicts on the whole file and the
  obvious fix is a recursive merge of the two objects. That is WRONG whenever either branch DELETED a
  key: a branch cut before the deletion still carries it, so "present in theirs, absent in ours" looks
  like an addition and the retired key comes back. Measured this session — r138 retired four wizard
  label groups, r141 predated that, and the merge silently restored all four in all six catalogs.
  **PRESENCE IS A VALUE. Consult the merge BASE for absence too:**
  - in base · gone from one side · unchanged in the other ⇒ **DELETE**
  - not in base · present on one side ⇒ ADD
  - deleted one side · modified the other ⇒ deletion wins, and REPORT it
  Get the base explicitly (`git merge-base HEAD^1 HEAD^2`) — the `:1` stage is gone once you commit.
  Assert afterwards that BOTH sides' additions and each side's deletions survived; the guard that
  caught this (`test/wizard-personnel-shared-fields.test.ts`) only exists because r140 wrote it.

- **AN EXACT-SET NAV GUARD MUST BE UPDATED, NOT LOOSENED, WHEN A ROW IS LEGITIMATELY ADDED.**
  `ADMIN_GROUP_FLAT_HREFS` (sidebar), `EXPECTED_SET` (payroll flyout) and the pack-drift allowlist all
  fail when a new row appears — that is their job: they catch a sibling accidentally CLIPPED by an
  edit. Declare the new row in the list. Only ONE agent per round may own each of these, or two
  branches both edit the same literal.

- **`redirect()` SIGNALS BY THROWING, so a success toast next to one gets swallowed.** A toast inside
  the same `try` is caught by the service-error handler and every SUCCESSFUL action redirects to
  `?error=NEXT_REDIRECT` — live for a whole release in the leave adjustment writer. Put the toast
  AFTER the redirect, never beside it.
- **A `labelKey` IS NOT THE LABEL.** Resolve the key against `messages/en.json` before describing
  what a screen says — a plan written off key names proposed three renames that were all already
  live. A key's NAME is not evidence of who reads it either: grep consumers before deleting keys by
  prefix (r137 deleted three shared `festive*` labels a surviving component used).
- **A date derived from an instant must go through the tenant timezone.** `toISOString().slice(0,10)`
  is YESTERDAY between 00:00 and 08:00 MYT. Use `todayInKualaLumpur()` for "what date is this
  instant"; date-only ARITHMETIC stays UTC. **This applies to FIXTURES too** — r92 fixed 45 app sites
  and skipped `test/`, and six test files then failed only at night (the product was right, the test
  was wrong). `test/today-in-myt-drift.test.ts` scans both. Every daytime green proves nothing about
  a timezone fix — re-verify inside 00:00–08:00 MYT. **Debugging an off-by-one date: check the clock
  before the code.**
- **THIS DOCUMENT'S SHIPPED LISTS ARE NOT EVIDENCE — in either direction.** An item recorded here as
  shipped had never merged (r76); slice 2 had no round entry and looked skipped but was live at 50
  call sites. Verify with `git log -S <symbol> main` before trusting any claim here.
- **i18n guard holes** (`test/i18n-coverage.test.ts` check C): it skips files using more than one
  namespace, and only matches LITERAL keys — `t(helperReturningKey(x))` is invisible.
  **THE SAME BLINDNESS MAKES "UNUSED KEY" A FALSE POSITIVE, and r159 nearly deleted three on it.**
  `fields.rateAmount`, `fields.dateOfBirth` and `fields.bankAccount` survive no literal grep, because
  the wizard's Review step renders `t(`fields.${f}`)` from whatever `missingByStep` returns
  (`app/admin/personnel/new/wizard.tsx:849`). Deleting them is a MISSING_MESSAGE on screens HR really
  reaches: a daily-paid hire with no rate, a malformed date, half a bank instruction. All three are
  pinned non-empty in all six catalogs by `test/wizard-personnel-shared-fields.test.ts`, and both
  component headers say so. **Before deleting any key, grep for the COMPUTED form (`` t(`prefix. ``)
  as well as the literal — absence from a literal grep is not evidence.** Prefer one
  namespace per file; for computed keys, test every value the helper can return.

- **A KEY THAT EXISTS BUT CANNOT FORMAT IS INVISIBLE TO CHECK C — third hole, found r140.** Check C
  asks whether the key resolves, and *existing* and *formatting* are different things. A message
  containing `{row}`/`{expected}` is ICU interpolation, so a plain `t('…')` with no arguments THROWS
  `FORMATTING_ERROR` at render and paints the literal key path on screen. **The route still returned
  200, tsc passed, and check C passed.** Only the dev-server log on a real render showed it. Use
  `t.raw()` when the braces are meant literally (e.g. a template a client island substitutes into),
  and remember that placeholder-looking text is a formatting contract, not decoration.
- **A REFUSAL TEST CAN BE PINNING SOMETHING OTHER THAN YOUR FIX — so REVERT THE FIX AND RE-RUN before
  you believe it (r172).** `3e3d3fb2`'s plan called the TP1 `?employmentId=` handling a security gap;
  three attempted exposures were all refused by RLS, including the manager branch the plan predicted
  would leak. The mutation check is what caught it: **with the guard reverted, the whole test file still
  passed**, because it was pinning RLS rather than the new guard. A green refusal test proves the
  behaviour is refused — NOT that your code is what refuses it.
- **THE PACK IMPORT RATCHET'S ALLOWLIST IS NOT A REGISTRATION POINT — READ ITS FAILURE TEXT (r175).**
  A new `core/` file imported `core/attendance` and `core/payroll` directly and turned BOTH drift
  ratchets red. The tempting fix is `test/pack-drift-allowlist.json`; the guards refuse it in their own
  message — "The allowlist only ever shrinks; do not add entries." That list is audited kernel-contract
  DEBT, not a place to file new work, and adding to it silently widens the ADR-0080 boundary the guard
  exists to hold. **Import from `packs/<pack>/service` instead.** Two things make that safe and both are
  worth checking rather than assuming: the facades re-export with `export *`, so every symbol resolves
  unchanged; and several `core/` files already import a facade (`absence-days`, `admin`, `entitlements`,
  `movement-apply`, `operator`), so it introduces no cycle. Check for the documented comment false
  positive first — the ratchet does not strip comments.

- **A MERGE CONFLICT WHERE NEITHER "OURS" NOR "THEIRS" IS CORRECT (r175).** `core/attendance.ts`
  collided between the shift item (which had just made `scheduleFor` DATE-AWARE via a new `defShiftOn(d)`
  helper) and the absence item (which had moved the same declaration earlier, still using the old
  `defShift` variable — which no longer existed). Taking ours dropped the absence item's roster-wins
  gate; taking theirs silently reverted date-aware shift resolution that was ALREADY DEPLOYED, and would
  not even have compiled. The resolution was semantic: one declaration on the date-aware helper, with the
  other branch's new gate rewired onto it. **When two branches touch one function in the same release,
  read what each was FOR before resolving — a clean-looking pick can revert live behaviour.**

- **A PLAN THAT PROMISED WHAT THE DATABASE REFUSES GETS RAISED, NOT PATCHED, AND NOT PUSHED AS A PLAN
  REVISION (r175).** `23390097` promised supervisors could roster future dates; RLS refuses it. Note the
  mechanism trap: `improve:push-plan` sets `status = 'planned'`, so pushing a revision onto a DEPLOYED
  item un-deploys it on the board and loses the record that the work shipped. Use `improve:raise`
  instead — the CLI documents it for exactly this ("a decision the pipeline surfaced that the reporter
  must own"), it lands as `open`, and `raiseFeedback` stamps `reporter_label = 'CLAUDE AI'`.

- **A GREEN SUITE, A 200, AND ONE OF TWO PDF RENDERERS ALL CALLED A PAGE CORRECT WHILE IT WAS WRONG
  (r175a).** The CP22 renderer silently DROPPED any line past the third in a multi-row block: a
  four-line Malaysian address filed to LHDN without its state, and box (b) short an allowance,
  understating declared remuneration. No warning, no ellipsis — the box looks full. 81 tests were green
  because every fixture used three address lines, while **the form is ruled for four**. Two lessons:
  **(1) test the row count the artefact actually prints, not the one that happens to fit**; and
  **(2) WHEN TWO RENDERERS DISAGREE, THAT DISAGREEMENT IS THE INSTRUMENT.** Poppler regenerates a field's
  appearance when `NeedAppearances` is set and drew the line whole; MuPDF and macOS Preview draw the
  embedded stream and showed the damage. Rasterise in BOTH (`mutool` and `pdftoppm` are available) — a
  fix that satisfies one is not a fix. The clip is the rect inset by 1pt, so a block sized "top of row 1
  to bottom of row R" also slices the Rth row's descenders; extend the rect DOWNWARD, which moves no
  text because `baseline_n = rectTop − 1 − n × pitch`.

- **STOPPING AN AGENT CAN LOSE UNCOMMITTED WORK THAT IS BETTER THAN ITS LAST COMMIT (r175a).** A fix
  agent was stopped to free the cluster for the gate; it had already committed a working fix, and had
  THREE further modified files uncommitted — the 900dpi measurement showing the last row's descenders
  were still being clipped. Merging the branch as-committed would have shipped the weaker fix silently,
  because the committed state passed its own tests. **Before merging a branch whose agent you stopped,
  run `git status` in its worktree and read the diff.** If it is coherent (tsc + its own tests), commit
  it — do not discard it as scratch.

- **`rejects.toThrow()` passes on the WRONG throw** — a fixture failing NOT NULL before reaching the
  constraint under test reads as a pass. Assert the constraint NAME or match the real Postgres error
  via `.cause` (Drizzle wraps as "Failed query: …").
- **Editing code by index arithmetic needs assertions IN the edit script** — r137's span-cutting went
  wrong three times (comment-embedded braces, `//`-commented declarations) and only in-script asserts
  caught it before writing. Removing a `Promise.all` element without its destructuring slot silently
  shifts every later variable.

## Entitlement facts — read before touching leave (re-verified on production 2026-07-31)

**r85 MOVED THE RULES. Anything (including old history entries) saying `leave_policy` owns earning
method or carry-forward is WRONG.**

- **Rules live on `leave_type`** (columns `0325`, engines repointed `0334`). `applyLeaveTypeRules`
  (`core/leave-compute.ts:489`) overlays them onto the resolved policy — a **whole-set** overlay
  gated on `hasAnyLeaveTypeRule`. 10 leave types carry type-level rules.
- **`leave_policy` still supplies DAYS** and is the rules fallback for types carrying none. 67 policy
  rows, 57 `earned_monthly`. **Zeroing `leave_policy` wholesale would stop accrual for every type
  that falls through** — removing the band SURFACE is safe; emptying the TABLE is not the same act.
- **DAYS precedence:** `entitledDays = max(floorDays, schemeDays ?? policyDays)`; `schemeBandDays`
  returning **null — not zero** — triggers the fallback.
- **`leave_policy` has no `updated_at`** — date a change via `leave-policy.updated` events, never
  `created_at`.
- **Coverage gap that bites at reset time:** 12 of 41 benefit schemes have zero entitlement rows;
  ISEDECOR BINA + Demo Group Holdings have no schemes at all. After a reset those employees drop to
  the statutory floor.

## Carried debt — none of it blocking, all of it real

1. **Browser verification of shipped UI remains the top gap.** Nearly everything since r70 is
   source-reasoned only. The r93 runners (jsdom in the gate, Chromium opt-in) cover `'use client'`
   islands — they do NOT retire manual verification, because async SERVER components cannot be
   rendered by testing-library and most pages here are server components. The one time a screen was
   browser-measured (`4dbe04c6`) it overturned the source-reading diagnosis.
2. **A rendered-markup test can still be blind** when a client component receives server-passed
   nodes — the fixture must be the POST-TRANSPORT shape (`test/organization-list-rsc-lazy.test.ts` is
   the worked example; the Companies screen rendered 1 of 8 rows for 24 days behind a green suite).
3. **Pagination pages in memory on ten tables** — `paginateRows()` fetches everything then slices.
   Contract holds; the promised speed does not. Pushing limit/offset into ~10 read functions is the
   follow-up.
4. **ADR-0077 slices** (plan at `~/.claude/plans/resilient-greeting-ripple.md`, 43 KB, written 26 Jul —
   re-verify against the tree before building any of it):
   | slice | state |
   |---|---|
   | 0–4 | **DONE** (invitation privesc fix · schema · `isModuleEnabled` (`a38ed02f`, 50 sites) · gate classification · nav/page gating) |
   | 5 | **DONE r97–r100** except the admin setup notification (no natural key on `notification`) |
   | 6 | **DONE r176 (2026-08-10), except the deploy-failing flip.** The jurisdiction sweep and the mixed-currency refusal both shipped: `core/report-registry.ts` narrows the currency-mix check to rows that actually CONTRIBUTE a money value (a row with no figure can no longer trigger a refusal), and `core/reporting.ts` gained `eaEmployerCountry()` so `employeeEaStatements` resolves each form's pack from its OWN employer's country via a `Map<companyId, country>` rather than the tenant default — in a multi-country group, foreign-entity forms were being built against the wrong pack. Pinned by `test/report-summary-mixed-currency.test.ts` and `test/ea-per-employer-pack.test.ts`. **Still open: the deploy-failing flip** (unclassifiable company: warning → failed deploy) — needs explicit confirmation, see the blocker list |
   | 7 | **WRITTEN, NEVER PROVISIONED.** `core/platform-usage.ts` (148 lines), `test/platform-plane.test.ts` (203), migration `0351` and the `ai_hr_platform` role definition in `deploy/bootstrap-db.sql` all exist. **But `PLATFORM_DATABASE_URL` is ABSENT from production's `.env.production` (re-verified 2026-08-09)**, so `platformPlaneConfigured()` is false and `pnpm platform:usage` exits 2 on the box. Create the role from `bootstrap-db.sql` and set the URL — cheapest remaining slice |
   | 8 | **DONE (r121 `901352c5`) — this row used to say "decide whether that gate should be removable at all", and that decision HAS been taken: not once history exists.** `chainArmingDecision` is wired into `db/client.ts:13` and REFUSES to disarm a tenant with chained history; `test/audit-hash-chain.test.ts:134` used to assert the hole and now asserts the refusal. Preflight `scripts/check-audit-chain-gate.ts`; `app/admin/privacy/page.tsx:53` records why there is no banner. **The hazard it closed, worth keeping:** events appended while the gate is off carry `chain_seq IS NULL`, so they are ABSENT from the chain rather than breaking it — re-arming links onto the last chained event, every `prev_hash` matches, and `verifyTenantChain()` returns valid over a log with an unprotected hole |
   | 9 | **CLOSURE AND REACTIVATION ARE BOTH BUILT — the old "Remaining: CLOSURE · REACTIVATION" here was stale.** `core/tenant-lifecycle.ts` carries `closureDecision` (dual control + its own retention check), `suspendedDaysWithin`, `shiftExpiryForSuspension` and `replayPlan`, all pinned by `test/tenant-lifecycle.test.ts`; schema in `0350`. `scripts/reactivate-tenant.ts` (145 lines) closes the window, records the event and PRINTS the replay plan — report-only until `--apply`, deliberately not firing sweeps at a customer's live payroll. **THAT GAP IS CLOSED — r176 (2026-08-10).** `scripts/close-tenant.ts` is `closureDecision`'s first caller. It carries a `--today` guard: without one, an arbitrary date silently defeats the retention hold the decision exists to enforce, so the script refuses a `--today` that is not the real MYT day unless explicitly overridden. Pinned by `test/tenant-closure-runner.test.ts`. Report-only until `--apply`, matching `reactivate-tenant.ts` |
   | 10 | **SCHEDULED 2026-08-09 — the bleed is STOPPED.** `capture-usage` runs daily at 01:00 (crontab, ahead of the leave sweeps); first scheduled-era run wrote 9 rows / 0 failures across 9 companies in 1 tenant. Env contract is **`MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, NOT the platform pool** — slice 7 is not a prerequisite, which is why this could ship ahead of it. **2026-08-03 → 2026-08-08 are permanently unbillable** — before this, `usage_snapshot` held 8 rows all dated 2026-08-02. The read model (`platformUsageSummary`, `pnpm platform:usage`) is done; the DASHBOARD is still unbuilt, deliberately — `/platform` needs its own auth boundary (`platform_user` ≠ `app_user`, ADR-0077 D5) and cannot reuse the tenant session |
   Slice 9's enforcement is inert in production today; `apply-dunning` is report-only and unscheduled.
   **An older line here said "both tenants `active`" — 2026-08-09's `capture-usage` run reported
   `1 tenant(s) in scope, 0 skipped` via the shared `loadSweepScope`, i.e. ONE tenant, not two out of
   two. Count before relying on either number.**
5. **Test-DB teardown is FIXED — kept so nobody "fixes" it again.** `test/global-setup.ts:298`,
   best-effort and never fatal. A run drops its own template and workers on exit.
6. **Dead/misplaced payroll config** (r78): `payment_basis` is written and read by nothing; probation
   months / review reminder days / default currency live on the payroll screen but belong elsewhere.
   No open item carries these any more — raise afresh if they matter.
7. **`tenant_module` has exactly ONE writer** — `scripts/module-change-runner.ts` draining
   `module_change_request` under the OWNER role. Never hand SQL. Reactivation NEVER re-seeds
   (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING), so a customer's edited settings survive a disable/enable cycle (D4,
   pinned by test).

---

**NO BRANCH IS IN FLIGHT — but `main` IS ahead of production by r177 (see CURRENT STATE).** The old text
here said "Nothing is in flight. r173 shipped 2026-08-08 … the only change since is the crontab line",
which was three rounds stale. Both pre-planning checks were re-run 2026-08-10 (r178). Every unmerged
`build/*` branch is STALE, not pending — `r71`, `r83`, `r154` (squashed, ancestrally unrelated),
`r163-g-release3` and `r163g-picker`, whose content reached main by another route: their migration `0405`
is on main as `0410_entitlement_reset_drop_old_layers.sql`, and `main` DELETES ~45,000 lines relative to
both, which is the tell. On ship, a round's entry moves to the top of `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`.
**"Nothing in flight" is a claim about BRANCHES — it is NEVER a claim that `main` has been deployed.
Prove that separately with the dry-run rsync above; r159 exists because those two were conflated.**

**Shipped round entries (r66–r176): `docs/HANDOFF-HISTORY.md`.**
